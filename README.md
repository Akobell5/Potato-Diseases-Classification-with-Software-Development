**Potato Disease Classification using TensorFlow Lite and Cloud Integration**

This repository presents a **machine learning pipeline** for detecting and classifying **potato leaf diseases** using deep learning models optimized for deployment on **mobile and IoT platforms**.  
The project includes the **model training, TensorFlow Lite conversion, API backend, frontend web app, and mobile app integration** — providing an end-to-end smart agriculture solution.

**Overview**

Potato diseases significantly reduce crop yields, especially in developing regions.  
This project leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically identify disease categories from leaf images and enables **real-time diagnosis** through edge or mobile deployment.

**Disease Type	Accuracy (%)	Model Size (MB)	Device**
Healthy	99.1	8.2	Mobile
Early Blight	98.4	8.2	Mobile
Late Blight	97.9	8.2	Mobile

**Applications**
Smart agriculture disease detection
Mobile farm assistant tools
Precision farming and data-driven crop management
IoT edge devices for real-time farm analytics

**Future Work**
Integration with ESP32-CAM for real-time detection
Expansion to multiple crops (tomato, maize, cassava)
Cloud dashboard for farm-level analytics
